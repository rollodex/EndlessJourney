# EndlessJourney
## Inspiration
Inspired by AI and the endless potential of GPT-3, this text adventure will challenge you and surprise you with one of a kind collectibles!

## What it does
This is a Journaling choose your own adventure game designed to be simple, entertaining and use the classification capabilities of GPT-3 to teach emotional understanding. 

## How we built it
The server was written in Python, and the core logic is a combination of Javascript and Python. 
The NFT collectible achievement badges are stored on the Neo N3 blockchain and will be tradable. 

## Challenges we ran into
GPT-3 is tricky, as it can be hard to keep the bot on track. I used a sentiment classification model borrowed from Psi-Theory and hope to make the sentiment feature incorporate an actual cognitive model in the future. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Building an AI powered NFT project 
Learning new design skills 

## What we learned
I learned a lot about the inner workings of GPT-3, the limitations of the technology and how to do sound prompt engineering

## What's next for Endless Journey
More graphics and UX design
Enhanced emotional feedback borrowed from MicroPsi
Saving of stories
